<p>I had to setup MySQL replication at work for a HA-like architecture. I hit my
head open for several days and thought it might be worth a blog post, since it
is actually pretty simple, even though reading billions of mysql documentation
did not help. So here it is, assuming that your master is already running,
with proper config (that is easy, so I won't insult your intelligence by
writing about it) :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If a slave process is running on your slave mysql, stop it :</p>

<p><code>(slave)mysql> STOP SLAVE;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Dump all the data from master :</p>

<p><code>romain@master $ mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases --master-data > dump.sql</code></p>

<p>Don't mess with the options, if you try to add other ones, there are chances
that they will fuck up the two that are really required, and nothing will
work. (I lost a lot of time because of that)</p></li>
<li><p>Run the CHANGE MASTER TO <strong>before</strong> injecting the dump. Changing master after
the dump will erase master informations written in the dump, and it will
just never work.</p>

<p><code>(slave)mysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST ='master.mydomain.com', MASTER_USER = 'replication', MASTER_PASSWORD = 'p4s5woRd';</code></p></li>
<li><p>Inject the dump on the slave :</p>

<p><code>(slave)mysql> source ~/dump.sql</code></p></li>
<li><p>Make some coffee if your dump is a bit large.</p></li>
<li><p>If you synchronized the <em>mysql</em> table (that's what I did), you can flush
privileges and restart mysql. I don't know if that is mandatory, though
it can't hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the slave process :</p>

<p><code>(slave)mysql> START SLAVE;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Look for errors :</p>

<p><code>(slave)mysql> SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G</code></p></li>
<li><p>Throw yourself out of the window if it still does not work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that is it. I managed to replicate a production mysql server, with no
downtime. The process took me about 10 minutes because we had more than
a gigabyte of data. I hope this is way clearer than what you will found
on the interweb.</p>
